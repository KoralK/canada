    <h2>Saskatchewan Immigrant Nominee Program (SINP)</h2>
    <p>The Saskatchewan Immigrant Nominee Program (SINP) is an immigration program that enables the province of Saskatchewan to nominate individuals for immigration to Canada. The SINP operates on an Expression of Interest (EOI) system, where candidates interested in immigrating to Saskatchewan must first submit an EOI profile online.</p>
    <p>The SINP uses five factors to assess candidates: education and training, skilled work experience, language ability, age, and connections to the Saskatchewan labour market. The SINP has several sub-categories, including International Skilled Worker Category, Saskatchewan Experience Category, and Entrepreneur and Farm Category.</p>
    <p>Each category and sub-category has its own eligibility requirements. For example, the International Skilled Worker Category requires candidates to score at least 60 points out of 100 on the SINP point assessment grid. Language ability is one of the factors assessed, and candidates must provide valid language test results from a designated testing agency. The results should match the language level declared in their EOI profile.</p>
